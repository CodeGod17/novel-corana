    <br>
    <h2 class="h2">What Is Vaccine?</h2>
<br>
<p class="p3">A substance used to stimulate the production of antibodies and provide immunity against one or several diseases, prepared from the causative agent of a disease, its products, or a synthetic substitute, treated to act as an antigen without inducing the disease.
    "there is no vaccine against the virus"</p>

    <h1 id="h9">Different Vaccines available For Covid-19</h1>
    <br>
    <h2 class="h2">1.Covaxin</h2>
    <br>

<br>
<p class="p3">COVAXIN®, India's indigenous COVID-19 vaccine by Bharat Biotech is developed in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) - National Institute of Virology (NIV).

    The indigenous, inactivated vaccine is developed and manufactured in Bharat Biotech's BSL-3 (Bio-Safety Level 3) high containment facility.
    
    The vaccine is developed using Whole-Virion Inactivated Vero Cell derived platform technology. Inactivated vaccines do not replicate and are therefore unlikely to revert and cause pathological effects. They contain dead virus, incapable of infecting people but still able to instruct the immune system to mount a defensive reaction against an infection.

    <h2 class="h2">2.Covishield</h2>
    <br>
    <img class="img1" src="in-sii.jpg" width="300px" height="335">
    <br>
    <p class="p3">You are being offered the Serum Institute of India Pvt. Ltd. (SIIPL) COVISHIELD™ Vaccine to prevent
        Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2. This Fact Sheet contains information
        to help you understand the risks and benefits of the COVISHIELD™ Vaccine, which you may receive
        because there is currently a pandemic of COVID-19 disease.
        In ongoing clinical trials, the COVISHIELD™ Vaccine has been shown to prevent COVID-19 disease
following 2 doses given between 4 and 12 weeks apart. The duration of protection against COVID-19
disease is currently unknown.
You may get protective immune response 4 weeks after the second dose of COVISHIELD™ vaccine
    </p>

    <br>
    <h2 class="h2">3.Pfizer</h2>
    <br>
    <img height="335px" width="300"  class="img1" src="pfizer-vaccine.jpg">
    <br>
    <p class="p3">Based on evidence from clinical trials in people aged 16 years and older, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was 95% effective at preventing laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 illness in people without evidence of previous infection.
        In clinical trials, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was also highly effective at preventing laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 illness in adolescents aged 12–15 years, and the immune response in people aged 12–15 years was at least as strong as the immune response in people aged 16–25 years.
        CDC will continue to provide updates as we learn more about how well the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine works in real-world conditions.</p>

        <h2 class="h2">4.Moderna</h2>

        <br>
        <p class="p3">
            Based on evidence from clinical trials, the Moderna vaccine was 94.1% effective at preventing laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 illness in people who received two doses who had no evidence of being previously infected.
The vaccine appeared to have high effectiveness in clinical trials (efficacy) among people of diverse age, sex, race, and ethnicity categories and among persons with underlying medical conditions.
Although few people in the clinical trials were admitted to the hospital, this happened less often in the people who got the Moderna vaccine compared to people who got the saline placebo.

        <h2 class="h2">Johnson&Johnson </h2>
        <br>
        <img class="img1" src="Johnson-Johnson-vaccine.jpg" height="335px" width="300px">
        <br>
        <p class="p3">The Johnson & Johnson (J&J) vaccine is a single-dose vaccine that can help prevent COVID-19. It’s the third COVID-19 vaccine authorizedTrusted Source by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for emergency use in the United States.

            Large-scale clinical trials in several locations across the globe found that a single dose of the J&J vaccine was effective at preventing COVID-19. They found that the vaccine can also protect against several viral variants.</p>

            <h2 class="h2">Sputnik-V</h2>
            <br>
            <img class="img1" src="sputnik-light-1620305640.jpg" height="335px" width="300px">
            <br>
            <p class="p3">The Russian COVID-19 vaccine Sputnik V (Gam-COVID-Vac) is an adenoviral-based, two-part vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Initially produced in Russia, Sputnik V uses a weakened virus to deliver small parts of a pathogen and stimulate an immune response.

                The Sputnik V (Gam-COVID-Vac) vaccine reduces the time taken for the actual development of immunity to SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind the COVID-19 pandemic.
                
                It is a vector vaccine based on adenovirus DNA, in which the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus gene is integrated. Adenovirus is used as a “container” to deliver the coronavirus gene to cells and start synthesizing the new coronavirus's envelope proteins, “introducing” the immune system to a potential enemy.</P>

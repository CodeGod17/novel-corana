    <h1>Precautions To Be Taken</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
<h2 class="h2">1.Wear A Mask</h2>
<br>

<br>
<p class="p2">
    Everyone 2 years and older should wear masks in public.
Masks should be worn in addition to staying at least 6 feet apart, especially around people who don’t live with you.
If someone in your household is infected, people in the household should take precautions including wearing masks to avoid spread to others.
Wash your hands or use hand sanitizer before putting on your mask.
Wear your mask over your nose and mouth and secure it under your chin.
Fit the mask snugly against the sides of your face, slipping the loops over your ears or tying the strings behind your head.
If you have to continually adjust your mask, it doesn’t fit properly, and you might need to find a different mask type or brand.
Make sure you can breathe easily.
</p>
<h2 class="h2">2.Maintain a Distace Of 1-2 metres</h2>
<br>

<br>
<p class="p2">
    Inside your home: Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
    If possible, maintain 6 feet between the person who is sick and other household members.
    Outside your home: Put 6 feet of distance between yourself and people who don’t live in your household.<br>
    Remember that some people without symptoms may be able to spread virus.
    Stay at least 6 feet (about 2 arm lengths) from other people.
    Keeping distance from others is especially important for people who are at higher risk of getting very sick.
</p>
<br>
<h2 class="h2">3.Avoid Crowded and poorly ventilated spaces</h2>

<br>
<p class="p2">Avoid crowds and poorly ventilated spaces
    Being in crowds like in restaurants, bars, fitness centers, or movie theaters puts you at higher risk for COVID-19.
    Avoid indoor spaces that do not offer fresh air from the outdoors as much as possible.
    If indoors, bring in fresh air by opening windows and doors, if possible.</p>
    <br>
    <h2 class="h2">4.Wash Hands Often</h2>
    <br>

<br>
<p class="p2">Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
    It’s especially important to wash:
    Before eating or preparing food
    Before touching your face
    After using the restroom
    After leaving a public place
    After blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing
    After handling your mask
    After changing a diaper
    After caring for someone sick
    After touching animals or pets
    If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.
    Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</p>
    <br>
    <h2 class="h2">5.Monitor Your Health on Daily Bases</h2>
    <br>

    <br>
    <p class="p2">Be alert for symptoms. Watch for fever, cough, shortness of breath, or other symptoms of COVID-19.
        Especially important if you are running essential errands, going into the office or workplace, and in settings where it may be difficult to keep a physical distance of 6 feet.
        Take your temperature if symptoms develop.
        Don’t take your temperature within 30 minutes of exercising or after taking medications that could lower your temperature, like acetaminophen.</p>
